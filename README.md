# 2009scape.org-backend

A basic Express router which serves as a read-only API to 2009scape.org

### Why?

* 2009scape.org is hosted on Github Pages
* That's free and forever, but static
* This router allows it to fetch data from 2009scape's server
* Could be easily modified to also write data

## Installation and Running
1. Clone repository and cd into it
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn start`

If running on a live server -

4. Portforward port 3000
5. Use your public IP to make fetches
